If you are seeing this error, reason could be

1) network is disabled during cargo build, or env OFFLINE=1 is set
2) your os/arch is unsupported (see https://github.com/btwiuse/pub/releases/latest/)
3) the ./staticlib/$os/$arch directory doesn't exist

Please consider installing via `go install` instead:

   go install github.com/btwiuse/pub/cmd/pub@latest
